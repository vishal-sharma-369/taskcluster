# Docker Images

This folder defines three images used for Taskcluster CI:

1. A docker image suitable for testing things in a browser.
2. A docker image used for testing things that need a running rabbit server.
3. A docker image containing both Node and Go, for `yarn generate`

The images are based on the same Node and Go versions as the rest of Taskcluster.
The image label is based on these versions.

To generate the docker images, [install jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/wiki/Installation) and run `./build-<imagename>.sh`.
If you are happy with the results, you have to push them to make them available for tests in Taskcluster.

## Browser Test

The browser-test image includes a copy of the ESR version of Firefox. Tests should not be
particularly sensitive to the Firefox version.

Test the browser-test image with the following, which approximates what runs in CI:

```shell
docker run -ti --rm -v $PWD:/repo taskcluster/browser-test:10.14.0 bash -c '
    git clone /repo /build &&
    cd /build/clients/client-web &&
    yarn &&
    { Xvfb :99 -screen 0 640x480x8 -nolisten tcp & } &&
    sleep 2 &&
    CHROME_BIN=firefox DISPLAY=:99 yarn test'
```

## Rabbit Test

This is pretty much exactly the standard node image but with rabbitmq-server installed.

## Node-Go

This is a base Node image with the necessary bits of the Golang image copied in.
This takes advantage of the fact that both images are based on Debian "bookworm".
